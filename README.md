Program allows the user to input values into a two-dimensional array and output the values from the array.

The program uses the input_table() function to input the values into the array, and the output_table() function to output the values from the array. The program also includes a menu function that allows the user to choose between inputting values into the array, outputting values from the array, or exiting the program.

The program uses dynamic memory allocation to allocate memory for the two-dimensional array, and also frees the memory after the program is done executing. The program includes the iostream and locale.h libraries to enable input/output and UTF-8 support for Polish characters.
